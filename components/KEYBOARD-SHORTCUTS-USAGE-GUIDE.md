### Conflicts with Browser Shortcuts?

- Windows/Linux users: Use `Ctrl`
- The help dialog shows the correct key for your platform

2. Use the help dialog (`?`) as a reference
3. Practice one shortcut at a time
4. Build muscle memory through repetition

1. Use `/` to quickly search without clicking
2. Use number keys to filter while browsing
3. Use `N` to create tickets without scrolling
4. Use `?` when you forget a shortcut
